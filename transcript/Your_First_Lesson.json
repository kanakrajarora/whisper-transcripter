    "transcription": " How to use your first lesson? You should already have my lessons now, so I want to tell you how to use them. I'm very excited because soon you will speak English easily and fast. English words will come out of your mouth automatically. You'll feel relaxed and confident when you speak English and you'll feel happy when you learn with my lessons. No more sad boring lessons. So how do you use my lessons? Here are some suggestions. Start with the first lesson set named a day for the dead. Listen to all lessons in the set every day for one week. Learn deeply. Listen to the mini story lesson two times a day or more. Answer the mini story questions loudly. Do not think about grammar. Do not try to memorize. Just relax. Listen. Respond. Everything will happen automatically. Most importantly, relax and smile as you listen to the lessons. If you don't want to speak yet, it's okay. Effortless English is a listen-first system. Listening is most important. It's okay to just listen. You will improve quickly and automatically if you listen every day. That is the key. Listen to the lessons one hour or more every day. That is all you need to do. Do that and I guarantee your success. Good luck and enjoy the lessons. Yes, if you don't have my lessons yet, get them now and start the first lessons set today. Start immediately."
